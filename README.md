# Sorghum Yield App

The Sorghum app aims to help farmers generate and store reports containing predictions on the yield of their sorghum fields. Users can input both photos and information about their fields, which are then analyzed within the app to calculate a yield prediction. Each report contains information regarding farm measurements, plant photos, and geological locations. This information will help K-State researchers and farmers alike.
